We want our transaction report to look something like this:

-----
I am making the following transactions for 2021-05-19:

One-time transactions today:

1. $100 Cardano ADA, Coinbase *
2. $100 Ethereum ETH, Coinbase *
3. $100 The Graph GRT, Coinbase
4. $100 Enjin ENJ, Coinbase
5. $100 Cosmos ATOM, Coinbase
6. $100 Litecoin LTC, Coinbase
7. $100 Bitcoin BTC, Coinbase

That's it for today.

* There were no recommendations for these two transactions; I bought these 
coins on sale, is all.
-----

This implies we have transactions (today) that are recommended and ones
that are not. So, we need to find this out from the join table: DONE in
the transaction-pull.
