We handle staking/earning/reinvesting differently from transactions in a few
ways: 1. we don't transfer out from the linked account, 2. these transactions
are handled differently for tax-purposes, 3. do these reinvestments make these
coins more desirable buys? TUNE IN NEXT WEEK FOR ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS, ...
AND MORE!
