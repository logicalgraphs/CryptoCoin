                                         cash = $0.00,
                                         raison = Just "BINANCE"}}),
                  ...,
                  ("USAA",
                   IxV {ix = 4, 
                        val = Portfolio {portfolioName = "USAA",
                                         cash = $-81.59
                                         raison = Just "BANK_ACCOUNT"}})]}

The data-files are in the format:

date,portfolio,direction,amount
2021-06-03,USAA,INCOME,$2000.00
2021-06-03,USAA,OUTGO,$800
2021-06-03,GEMINI,INCOME,$800

and are named transfers.csv

And with that, we can now do, e.g.:

>>> cr <- getEnv "CRYPTOCOIN_DIR"
>>> transfers <- readCashTransfers (cr ++ "/data-files/transfers/2021-06-03/cash.csv")

>>> transfers
[CashTransfer {dt = 2021-06-03, port = "USAA", dir = INCOME, amt = $2000.00},
 CashTransfer {dt = 2021-06-03, port = "USAA", dir = OUTGO, amt = $800.00},
 CashTransfer {dt = 2021-06-03, port = "GEMINI", dir = INCOME, amt = $800.00}]

So! We want to store these transfers, then group them by portfolio, then update
each portfolio's cash reserve.
