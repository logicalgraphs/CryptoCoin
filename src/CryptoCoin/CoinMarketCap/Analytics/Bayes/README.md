# Bayesian Analysis

What is a good buy or sell call? What does that look like? We have a set
of recommendations for a coin, we have the coin information on the day the
recommendation was made and, now, in "the future," we have that coin 
information. Was the buy or sell recommendation a good one? Or was, even,
no action better?

Let's find out.

How?

Bayes. A recipe.

1. accumulate all recommendations.
2. For each recommendation, fetch the coin info for that recommendation (on that
date).
3. Fetch the coin info for today for each recommended coin.
4. If we bought $100 (with commission) then. If we sold the coin today (with
commission, did we make money? How much?

Hopefully, we have a Bayesian solution that will tell us all this with ...
wait for it ... confidence.

Ya see what I did there?
