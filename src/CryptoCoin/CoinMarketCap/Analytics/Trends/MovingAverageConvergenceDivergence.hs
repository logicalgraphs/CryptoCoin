What Is Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)?
Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.

MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.
