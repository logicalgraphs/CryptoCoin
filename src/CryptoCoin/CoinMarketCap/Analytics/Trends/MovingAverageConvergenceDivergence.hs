What Is Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)?
Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum 
indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a 
securityâ€™s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period 
exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.

MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the 
short-term EMA (12 periods). An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of 
moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most 
recent data points.
