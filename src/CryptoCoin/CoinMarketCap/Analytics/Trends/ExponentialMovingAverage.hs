What Is an Exponential Moving Average (EMA)?
An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that 
places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. The 
exponential moving average is also referred to as the exponentially weighted 
moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average reacts more 
significantly to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA), 
which applies an equal weight to all observations in the period.
