Abandoned Baby

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/092315/5-most-powerful-candlestick-patterns.asp#abandoned-baby

The bullish abandoned baby reversal pattern appears at the low of a downtrend, 
after a series of black candles print lower lows. The market gaps lower on the 
next bar, but fresh sellers fail to appear, yielding a narrow range doji 
candlestick with opening and closing prints at the same price. A bullish gap on 
the third bar completes the pattern, which predicts that the recovery will 
continue to even higher highs, perhaps triggering a broader-scale uptrend. 
According to Bulkowski, this pattern predicts higher prices with a 49.73% 
accuracy rate.
