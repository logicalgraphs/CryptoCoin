First iteration of scanFile where YieldFarm = String:

0 - [JEWEL]-[WONE] Uni LP [+] [-] [<=>] Price: $2.02 TVL: $51,097,846.16
JEWEL Price: $4.40
WONE Price: $0.22
Staked: 24970606.4902 JEWEL-LP ($50,340,218.91)
JEWEL Per Week: 7294070.35 ($32,088,439.83)
So, a YieldFarm is the one that provides the most JEWEL / USD

With those 3 new functions, we now have:
